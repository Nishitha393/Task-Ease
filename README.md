# Task-Ease
**Tech for mobile apps final project**
This React Native app is a simple task management tool called "Task Ease." It allows users to log in, sign up, add tasks, edit task completion percentage, and log out. The app's main features include:

Task Management: Once logged in, users can add tasks to their to-do list. Each task can have a completion percentage associated with it.
Task Editing: Users can edit the completion percentage of tasks to track their progress.
Logout: Users can log out of their account when they're done using the app.

Execution Steps:
-> Install dependencies: Run **npm install** or yarn install.
-> Start the Metro Bundler: Run **npx react-native start**.
-> Run the app on iOS simulator: Run **npx react-native run-ios**.
-> The app will launch on the iOS simulator, where you can interact with it to manage tasks.
